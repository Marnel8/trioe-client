  {
    id: 1,
    question: "What is the fundamental unit of information in digital logic?",
    options: ["Byte", "Bit", "Nibble", "Word"],
    correctAnswer: "Bit",
    explanation: "A bit (binary digit) is the most basic unit of information in digital logic, representing either 0 or 1.",
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    question: "Which Boolean operation outputs true only when both inputs are true?",
    options: ["OR", "AND", "NOT", "XOR"],
    correctAnswer: "AND",
    explanation: "The AND operation (âˆ§) only outputs true (1) when both inputs are true (1), making it useful for checking multiple conditions.",
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    question: "What is the main advantage of NAND and NOR gates?",
    options: [
      "They are faster",
      "They use less power",
      "They are universal gates",
      "They are easier to build"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "They are universal gates",
    explanation: "NAND and NOR are called universal gates because any other logic gate can be constructed using only NAND gates or only NOR gates.",
  },
  {
    id: 4,
    question: "In a full adder circuit, how many inputs are there?",
    options: ["2", "3", "4", "5"],
    correctAnswer: "3",
    explanation: "A full adder has three inputs: two bits to be added (A and B) and a carry-in bit from the previous addition.",
  },
  {
    id: 5,
    question: "What distinguishes sequential circuits from combinational circuits?",
    options: [
      "Number of gates used",
      "Power consumption",
      "Memory elements",
      "Operating speed"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Memory elements",
    explanation: "Sequential circuits contain memory elements (like flip-flops) that store state information, while combinational circuits only depend on current inputs.",
  },
  {
    id: 6,
    question: "What is De Morgan's theorem used for?",
    options: [
      "Simplifying Boolean expressions",
      "Building flip-flops",
      "Creating truth tables",
      "Measuring circuit delay"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Simplifying Boolean expressions",
    explanation: "De Morgan's theorem is a powerful tool for simplifying Boolean expressions by showing the relationship between AND, OR, and NOT operations.",
  },
  {
    id: 7,
    question: "Which type of flip-flop changes state on every clock pulse when enabled?",
    options: ["D Flip-flop", "T Flip-flop", "SR Flip-flop", "JK Flip-flop"],
    correctAnswer: "T Flip-flop",
    explanation: "The Toggle (T) flip-flop changes its state (toggles between 0 and 1) whenever it receives a clock pulse while the T input is 1.",
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    question: "What is the purpose of a multiplexer in digital circuits?",
    options: [
      "To store data",
      "To perform arithmetic",
      "To select one of many inputs",
      "To generate clock signals"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "To select one of many inputs",
    explanation: "A multiplexer (MUX) selects one of several input signals and forwards it to a single output based on select line values.",
  },
  {
    id: 9,
    question: "Which Boolean law states that A + 1 = 1?",
    options: [
      "Identity law",
      "Complement law",
      "Null law",
      "Maximum law"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Maximum law",
    explanation: "The maximum law states that any value OR 1 equals 1, just as any value AND 0 equals 0 (minimum law).",
  },
  {
    id: 10,
    question: "What type of circuit is a binary counter?",
    options: [
      "Combinational",
      "Sequential",
      "Analog",
      "Asynchronous only"
    ],
    correctAnswer: "Sequential",
    explanation: "A binary counter is a sequential circuit because it needs to remember its current count value to determine the next count value.",
  },
